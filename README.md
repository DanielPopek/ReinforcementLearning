# Reinforcement Learning 

## Introduction

The aim of this project was to implement Reinforcement Learning approach for chess game simulator. Q-Learning algorithm from following publication was used:

> Watkins, Christopher JCH, and Peter Dayan. "Q-learning." Machine learning 8.3-4 (1992): 279-292. 

Results from Q-learning table were then used to train neural network classifier enabling more generalized prediction for player's next actions. 

More detailed problem description and outcoms of parameters research included in [RESEARCH.pdf](https://github.com/DanielPopek/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/RESEARCH.pdf) (document in Polish).
